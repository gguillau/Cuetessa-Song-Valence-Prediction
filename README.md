# Practicum Task for Cuetessa, Inc. â€“ Predicting Valence of Pop Songs

## Objective

Valence describes the musical positiveness of a track, e.g. ranging from sad/depressed to happy/cheerful.  An automatic method of classifying the valence of pop songs is useful for playlist curation and other applications.  The aim of this task is to develop a Python-based module to predict the valence of newly released pop songs.  

- Two approaches are to use as input: 
  - 1) the audio data (e.g., .wav files) of songs and 
  - 2) the lyrics of songs.  
 
Publicly available datasets can be used for training and testing.

Lyrics dataset found on Kaggle that contains full lyrics and labels of more than 150,000 songs [6]. The label is the Spotify valence attribute, ranging from 0 to 1. It describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (happy, cheerful), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (sad, depressed).
